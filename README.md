This repository contains a **Scriptable widget** for the Scriptable app that displays Islamic prayer times for **Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sand≈æak**. The widget uses the **Vaktija.ba API** to fetch accurate prayer times but is **not affiliated** with Vaktija.ba in any way.  

Designed for a **horizontal layout**, the widget follows the **original Vaktija.ba colors and feel**, providing a seamless and familiar experience.  

> The default city in the widget is **Sarajevo (ID 77)**. To change the city code, visit [City Codes](#city-codes).

## Features

-   Displays Islamic prayer times for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sand≈æak.
-   Uses **Vaktija.ba API** for accurate prayer times.
-   Designed for a **horizontal layout** with a modern and clean look.
-   Shows a **countdown to the next prayer** for better time tracking.
-   Uses the **original Vaktija.ba colors and feel**.
-   Automatically updates at **00:00** and when the widget is loaded.

## Design  

The **Scriptable Vaktija Widget** is designed with a **horizontal layout**, ensuring a clean and structured display of prayer times. The design follows the **original Vaktija.ba colors and feel**, providing a familiar experience.  

### Colors  
- **Background**: `#1e2227` (Dark theme for better contrast)  
- **Header & Countdown**: `#a59573` (Inspired by Vaktija.ba's aesthetic)  
- **Text**: White (`#ffffff`) for optimal readability  

### Layout  
The widget is divided into **two columns**:  
1. **Left Column**  
   - Displays the **Vaktija.ba header**  and a **name of the upcoming prayer**
   - Shows a **countdown** ‚è≥ to the next prayer time  
   - Below the countdown, the **name of the chosen city** is displayed  
   - A horizontal separator (`<hr>`) for visual clarity  
   - **Last fetched time** üïí (Indicates when the API was last accessed)  

2. **Right Column**  
	- **The Hijri calendar** date
   - Displays **prayer times for the day** in a structured list  
   - Centered for balance and readability  

### Countdown  
The countdown dynamically updates and shows the **remaining time** until the next prayer. This ensures users always have a quick glance at how much time is left before the upcoming prayer.  

Due to Apple widget limitations, the countdown updates every minute, and displaying seconds is not supported.

### Last Fetched Time  
The **üïí last fetched time** at the bottom of the left column shows when the API was last accessed. The widget only fetches new data **once on load and at midnight (00:00:00)** to avoid unnecessary API requests.

	   -    Choose the script **"Vaktija.ba"** from the list.
	   -    Ensure the **widget refreshes properly** by allowing background updates.

## Customization

You can modify the script inside **Scriptable** to adjust certain aspects:

-   **City Code:** Change the `CITY` variable in the script to fetch data for a different location.
-   **Colors:** Modify `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, or `headerColor` in the script for a different look.
-   **Font Size:** Increase or decrease `Font.systemFont(size)` for better readability.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Ensure that any modifications follow Scriptable‚Äôs syntax rules to avoid errors.

### City codes
You can find the available city codes here: https://api.vaktija.ba/vaktija/v1/lokacije
To change the city in the script, find your city ID from the link above and modify the following line in the script:

    const  CITY  =  "77";

**City ID 77** is for **Sarajevo**.

Replace `"77"` with the ID of your preferred city to display prayer times for that location.


## Issues

-   Due to **Apple widget limitations**, the **countdown updates every minute** (seconds are not displayed).
-   Widgets on iOS **refresh in the background every 15-30 minutes**, so real-time updates are not guaranteed.
-   If the widget **doesn‚Äôt update**, manually open **Scriptable** and run the script to force a refresh.
