-   Shows a **countdown to the next prayer** for better time tracking.

-   Automatically updates at **00:00** and when the widget is loaded.

## Design  

The **Scriptable Vaktija Widget** is designed with a **horizontal layout**, ensuring a clean and structured display of prayer times. The design follows the **original Vaktija.ba colors and feel**, providing a familiar experience.  

### Colors  
- **Background**: `#1e2227` (Dark theme for better contrast)  
- **Header & Countdown**: `#a59573` (Inspired by Vaktija.ba's aesthetic)  
- **Text**: White (`#ffffff`) for optimal readability  

### Layout  
The widget is divided into **two columns**:  
1. **Left Column**  
   - Displays the **Vaktija.ba header**  and a **name of the upcoming prayer**
   - Shows a **countdown** ‚è≥ to the next prayer time  
   - Below the countdown, the **name of the chosen city** is displayed  
   - A horizontal separator (`<hr>`) for visual clarity  
   - **Last fetched time** üïí (Indicates when the API was last accessed)  

2. **Right Column**  
	- **The Hijri calendar** date
   - Displays **prayer times for the day** in a structured list  
   - Centered for balance and readability  

### Countdown  
The countdown dynamically updates and shows the **remaining time** until the next prayer. This ensures users always have a quick glance at how much time is left before the upcoming prayer.  

Due to Apple widget limitations, the countdown updates every minute, and displaying seconds is not supported.

### Last Fetched Time  
The **üïí last fetched time** at the bottom of the left column shows when the API was last accessed. The widget only fetches new data **once on load and at midnight (00:00:00)** to avoid unnecessary API requests.  


## Preview

There are currently two types of widgets available, both designed to enhance your experience. Regardless of which one you choose, the installation process remains the same.

### Regular widget

The widget follows a horizontal layout and is available in two file formats: **Vaktija.ba.scriptable** and **Vaktija.ba.scriptable.js**.
It provides additional details such as the selected location, a countdown timer to the next prayer, and the Hijri calendar date. However, it requires a full horizontal layout on iPhone to display all information properly.

### Mini widget

Regular layout. File name **Vaktija Mini Widget.scriptable** and **Vaktija Mini Widget.scriptable.js**.
It does not display details such as the selected location or countdown timer, but **it visually indicates the next prayer time using circles** - only the upcoming prayer will have a filled circle, while the others remain empty.

## Customization

You can modify the script inside **Scriptable** to adjust certain aspects:

-   **City Code:** Change the `CITY` variable in the script to fetch data for a different location.
-   **Colors:** Modify `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, or `headerColor` in the script for a different look.
-   **Font Size:** Increase or decrease `Font.systemFont(size)` for better readability.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Ensure that any modifications follow Scriptable‚Äôs syntax rules to avoid errors.

### City codes
You can find the available city codes here: https://api.vaktija.ba/vaktija/v1/lokacije
To change the city in the script, find your city ID from the link above and modify the following line in the script:

    const  CITY  =  "77";

**City ID 77** is for **Sarajevo**.

Replace `"77"` with the ID of your preferred city to display prayer times for that location.


## Issues

-   Due to **Apple widget limitations**, the **countdown updates every minute** (seconds are not displayed).
-   Widgets on iOS **refresh in the background every 15-30 minutes**, so real-time updates are not guaranteed.
-   If the widget **doesn‚Äôt update**, manually open **Scriptable** and run the script to force a refresh.
